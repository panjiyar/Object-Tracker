I have tried to answer the first question - 
"Where is the vehicle in subsequent frames of the video given the location in the first frame?"

This will automatically bring one pic after another,
and at the same time try to create a box around the car.
Comments are put in inside the code for understanding.

Steps taken:

1. RGB to HSV
2. Found boundary values. They coincided with the road.
3. Background subtraction, leaving  us with car and road
4. Linear regression on rest of the points, which was basically
   along the road.
5. Found the car by moving a little above the line found by 
   linear regression.
6. Created a binding box, also counted for tires which were lost
   since they were on the same level as the road.

If I had more time, I could have probably added k nearest neighbours
to the first half of the dataset. It wouldn't have worked after that 
because of the huge changes in each frame.
Also, I would have tried to figure out what happens in the last frame.
